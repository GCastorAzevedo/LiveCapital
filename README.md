# LiveCapital
Live Capital challenge. A small app designed in Django.

## Initialization:
```console
  > virtualenv .
  > source bin/activate
  > cd app
  > make start

```
Then, go to localhost:8000/app

## TODOS:
. Unit tests;
. File Check validity (bad formatting will break the code) and proper error handling;
. Configure POSTGRES in docker-compose.yml (initialization time orders issues);
. Design and set home view and its url;
. Makefile issue: not able to initialize virtualenv from within;
